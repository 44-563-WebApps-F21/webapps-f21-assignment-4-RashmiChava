    <h6 class = "name LORD GORING">LORD GORING</h6><p class="speech">, _dressed in the height of fashion_, _is lounging in an
        armchair_.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _is standing in front of the fireplace_.
        _He is evidently in a state of great mental excitement and distress_.</p>
        <p class="stage_directions">[_As the scene progresses he paces nervously up and down the room_.]</p>
        
        <h6 class = "name LORD GORING">LORD GORING</h6> <p class="speech">My dear Robert, it’s a very awkward business, very awkward
        indeed.  You should have told your wife the whole thing.  Secrets from
        other people’s wives are a necessary luxury in modern life.  So, at
        least, I am always told at the club by people who are bald enough to know
        better.  But no man should have a secret from his own wife.  She
        invariably finds it out.</p>  <p class="stage_directions">[Women have a wonderful instinct about things.]</p>
        <p class = "speech">They can discover everything except the obvious.</p>
        
        <h6 class = " name SIR ROBERT CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6> <p class="speech">Arthur, I couldn’t tell my wife.  When could I have
        told her?  Not last night.  It would have made a life-long separation
        between us, and I would have lost the love of the one woman in the world
        I worship, of the only woman who has ever stirred love within me.  Last
        night it would have been quite impossible.  She would have turned from me
        in horror . . . in horror and in contempt.</p>
        
        <h6 class = "name LORD GORING">LORD GORING</h6> <p class="speech">Is Lady Chiltern as perfect as all that?</p>
