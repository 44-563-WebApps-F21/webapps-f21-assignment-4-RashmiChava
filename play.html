    <h2>An Ideal Husband</h2>
    <h3>_Morning-room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House_</h3>
    <p><h6 class = "name LORD_GORING">LORD GORING</h6><p class="speech">, _dressed in the height of fashion_, _is lounging in an
        armchair_.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _is standing in front of the fireplace_.
        _He is evidently in a state of great mental excitement and distress_.</p>
        <p class="stage_directions">[_As the scene progresses he paces nervously up and down the room_.]</p>
        
        <h6 class = "name LORD_GORING">LORD GORING</h6> <p class="speech">My dear Robert, it’s a very awkward business, very awkward
        indeed.  You should have told your wife the whole thing.  Secrets from
        other people’s wives are a necessary luxury in modern life.  So, at
        least, I am always told at the club by people who are bald enough to know
        better.  But no man should have a secret from his own wife.  She
        invariably finds it out.</p>  <p class="stage_directions">[Women have a wonderful instinct about things.]</p>
        <p class = "speech">They can discover everything except the obvious.</p>
        
        <h6 class = " name SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6> <p class="speech">Arthur, I couldn’t tell my wife.  When could I have
        told her?  Not last night.  It would have made a life-long separation
        between us, and I would have lost the love of the one woman in the world
        I worship, of the only woman who has ever stirred love within me.  Last
        night it would have been quite impossible.  She would have turned from me
        in horror . . . in horror and in contempt.</p>
        
        <h6 class = "name LORD_GORING">LORD GORING</h6> <p class="speech">Is Lady Chiltern as perfect as all that?</p>
        
        <h6 class = "name SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6> <p class="speech">Yes; my wife is as perfect as all that.</p>
        
        <h6 class = "name LORD_GORING">LORD GORING</h6> <p class="stage_directions">[_Taking off his left-hand glove_.]</p> 
        <p class = "speech">What a pity!  I beg
        your pardon, my dear fellow, I didn’t quite mean that.  But if what you
        tell me is true, I should like to have a serious talk about life with
        Lady Chiltern.</p>
        
        <h6 class = "name SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6> <p class="speech">It would be quite useless.</p>
        
        <h6 class = "name LORD_GORING">LORD GORING</h6> <p class="speech">May I try?</p>
        
        <h6 class = "name SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6> <p class="speech">Yes; but nothing could make her alter her views.</p>
        
        <h6 class = "name LORD_GORING">LORD GORING</h6> <p class="speech">Well, at the worst it would simply be a psychological experiment.</p>
        
        <h6 class = "name SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6> <p class="speech"> such experiments are terribly dangerous.</p>
        
        <h6 class = "name LORD_GORING">LORD GORING</h6><p class="speech">Everything is dangerous, my dear fellow.  If it wasn’t so,
        life wouldn’t be worth living. . . . Well, I am bound to say that I think
        you should have told her years ago.</p>
